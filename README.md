# daily-planner


## Description

I started this project with the intention of creating an easy way to keep track of my time and what I need to do each day. This project allows you to save your hourly tasks for a single day so that you can better organize your schedule. Throughout this project, I learned how to use third-party Web APIs such as jQuery, Bootstrap, and DayJS.
